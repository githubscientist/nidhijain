    Programming languages -> to communicate with the computer

    Computers only understand 0's and 1's (which is called binary number system or binary language). This is also called as machine language.

    Java Programming Language:
        - Java is a high level programming language.
        - Java is a platform independent language.
        - Java requires JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to run the program.
        - Java is a case sensitive language.
        - Java is an object oriented programming language.(purely object oriented language)
    
    Java Virtual Machine (JVM):
        - JVM is a software that is used to run the java program.
        - JVM is platform dependent.
        - JVM is a part of JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
        - JVM is responsible to convert the byte code into machine code.
        - JVM is responsible to allocate the memory to the program.
        - JVM is responsible to execute the program.

    Data types:

    int - 4 bytes
    float - 4 bytes
    double - long decimal values - 8 bytes
    char - 2 bytes
    boolean - true/false - 1 byte
    String - "Hello World" - 22 bytes
    byte - 1 byte
    short - 2 bytes
    long - 8 bytes

    Operators:

    Arithmetic Operators:
        + addition
        - subtraction
        * multiplication
        / division
        % modulus

    Relational Operators:
        < less than
        > greater than
        <= less than or equal to
        >= greater than or equal to
        == equal to
        != not equal to
    
    Logical Operators:
        && and
        || or
        ! not
    
    Bitwise Operators:
        & and
        | or
        ^ xor
        ~ not
        << left shift
        >> right shift
        >>> unsigned right shift
